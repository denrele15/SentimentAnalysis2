2	I really had a solid day apart from being able to work out. I should start going for walks after or before my shifts on the days that I do not have time to go to the gym. 
2	Today was a great day. Productive and I used my brain a lot so my brain felt like mush at the end of the day. But I got lots of work done and I am proud of the work I accomplished today. I feel like I fit in with the staff at SMH and I feel more and more comfortable and confident in practicum each day at SMH. I only have one more week with Dena doing admin at SMH and I am already sad about leaving. I have really enjoyed my time at SMH in level 2
2	Chill sunday full of things I love. Finished cobra kai
2	Writing about today and yesterday because i missed my blog
2	Today was a lot of ups and downs. I got up and went for s run right away
2	Today I felt like I socialized more than usual which made me feel better about my day. I am stressed about getting everything done for the weeks coming up
2	Today was a pretty good day. Worked out
2	Today I am thankful for my friends who were kind enough to listen to me when I had a problem. I am also thankful for the open community I joined and how honest this women was about her vegan life. I am also thankful for the amazing food my mom can make and how tasty it was. I completed a bunch of Q life activities I had piling up here on the site and it felt so amazing to complete them all. I could have spent time working on school activities
2	Haven't journaled in a bit. Crazy week. Finished admin rotation at Soldiers Memorial Hospital. 2 more weeks of admin at Valley Regional Hospital and then I start clinical. Special meal day was last Thursday and it went great. I had my IUD appointment last Tuesday. I have more appointments coming up next week which I am a bit nervous about. Cole and I haven't been getting along great lately. I am trying to focus on myself while he is at work. I try to be productive around the apartment but also mentally. I cleaned today
2	First day back journaling for the first time in a bit. Took a break while I was in NB because I was more focused on drinking and hanging out with friends. I think this is something I could definitely get done even when I have a night where I go drinking. Instead of doing the writing while I am drunk I can do the writing the morning after and try to remember all the different things I do throughout the day. I am gonna do this next time I am going out. I drank waaaay too much I think
2	Today is Sunday. Slept in which was nice. Got some stuff done that I wanted to. But as always
2	today i started in a mood
2	Today was a day where I took a day off from the gym so I did not really move around much at all until I had to go to work
2	Pretty dece
2	Today wasn't too bad. I liked my outfit
2	Today was a frustrating day to say the least. I wish I was a little more in control of myself the night before
2	On day 6 of recovering from surgery. Minimal mobility is really taking a toll on me. I wish I could move around and get more physical activity. I think I would also benefit from napping and I should really try to nap more often while I still can during this recovery period. I am getting tired of feeling lazy. Although I still dread going back to crazy practicum schedules
2	The past week has been stressful as I spent the entire time at home with the family. But today was great
2	I like this
2	Sunday
2	Today was good but okay I had a hair appointment so now I feel more confident about myself. Started my biomechanics assignment but feeling overwhelmed for the soc midterm tomorrow 
2	monday
2	"I forgot to do the last 2 days of this oops but im going to try and do it every day from now on! I feel content with myself and self aware of the actions I am taking. Today I noticed myself being condensending when I was explaining about my big ""squat"" I did earlier. No need to talk about yourself"
2	Today I was super hungover and very unproductive. I did draw though which was nice. I didn?€?t get done what i needed to get done
2	Today I'm thankful for the sun shining brightly through the living room windwo. I'm thankful for time to do some laundry. I'm thankful for Eric stoking the furnace before going to work. I'm thankful for clarity on how to deal with my eyeglasses.
2	Bad day today. Really stressful day at practicum trying to figure out the details about my special meal project and start the finance assignment. Fridays are always busy so Dena was busy herself and we didn't get much done on our calendars for today. I had an awful night last night stressing about my special meal and had a terrible time falling asleep. Cole was very understanding and sweet and he helped me calm down last night. He bought me a bottle of wine to help me relax tonight. I am so grateful for him.
2	Just having a bad day
2	Today flew by crazy fast
2	wrote 2 mid terms today. 1 went well the other didn't. Studied all day for another mid term and then had a meeting with a ex pro player to train me for the rest of the semester. I can't wait to start to put in the work with him. I also saw a girl at the lib and was able to get her contact and i'm now waiting for her to add me on snap. I'm a bit anxious because i haven't been added yet. I can't get too worked up because she may be busy
2	I have been on an up swing today. My girlfriend and I were having an awful fight for about 24 hours and I am also recovering from becoming quite sick last week. 
2	Tues Oct 20
2	Today me and mom went out to the pop up shop with a bunch of local buisnesses and got some cookies and cheesecake from the local business. We also went to a new location store where I was able to find a Christmas gift for Lynn and one for mom. And they?€?re super cute. I really liked that shop. We got the Christmas tree up and even made a back drop of a fireplace for behind it. It was a really fun needed break from school and work stress 
2	Busy but a good day...Class
2	Had some notes to do for my classes that a got done
2	I just got back from spending the weekend at StFX university visiting my best friend. I had such a great weekend and I made some new friends as well. It got me excited for Christmas break because I get to see her again. 
2	Woke up with my girlfriend in the morning and hung out with her for the morning
2	Today I woke up and went to my 8
2	Today I woke up early and ate breakfast which is something that I do not always do. I prepared for my presentation with my advisor and gave a good presentation. I am happy with how the presentation went and now feel that I am ready to continue working on my independent study. I am grateful for my advisor for all that he has and is doing for my education. My girlfriend came back home after being away for a night. I now feel less tense and happier that she is home. I was able to go grocery shopping with her and I am proud of myself that I went with her. I am not always able to go due to not scheduling my time properly. We ate a nice dinner and talked about our objectives for the rest of the week. This made me feel less anxious. I am going to bed by 9
2	I feel so tired
2	Got a lot of progress done on work
2	Today I got the news that we were hit with 11 new cases of covid 19. I knew that if cases kept rising that I would be risking living at home cheaply with my parents and I now think I should have never applied to get the jobs I have currently. I am frustrated and I feel trapped. The thing is
2	Feeling great today. Busy but good day at practicum. Lots of projects on the go and still feeling stressed but trying to focus on the big picture. Practicum is flying by. This week is flying by. The busier I am
2	Stayed up way too late on my phone which made me sleep in past my alarm. I planned to get through a bunch of lectures I am behind on but since i slept in I didnt start as early as I wanted to. Then my friend asked me to drive her to a doctors appointment so of course I did. I was glad to help her out but this also delayed my homework start even further so I didn't really get to working on school work until about 4PM. I also did not eat regular meals today so I was feeling hungry. My energy levels were low so when I was doing school work I was not able to focus well.
2	finally moved out of Nova scotia. I found a person to take the room and we are finalizing the paper work. It's good to be back home in ontario and with my girlfriend again.
2	I spent some quality time with Eric this weekend. It felt good to reconnect and make some plans/learn some skills to strengthen our marriage.

2	Today I had the realization that the Q life program has real benefits to my life. I have been paying much more attention to the way that i talk to myself and the way that i speak to others. I am putting effort into finding the good in things and being much more positive all around. I also had this realization and immediately decided that I wanted to journal it because it hepls me organize my thoughts.

2	Today was a better day at practicum. Productive morning but frustrating afternoon because the laptop I use doesn't always work and it didn't let me save the document I was working on so I had to do it a second time. And then I had to step out of the room which made me lose time to get work done during the day. I felt exhausted and almost fell asleep during a meeting. I need to get more sleep tonight.

2	I'm starting my day with a lot to do in this upcoming weekend school wise. It doesn't seem to end with the amount of work I need to get done. I'm trying to prepare by scheduling times outside of my room to take walks and go to the gym so I won't be sitting at my desk all day. I've been having trouble with overthinking and underappreciating the work I am doing on a daily basis. I focus sometimes on that one thing I didn't get done or when I did poorly on a quiz when I got all this other work done that I should be proud of. I'm trying to take steps back to see the bigger picture daily
2	So much to do still for school but now the kids are here 24/7......trying to push forward a bit at a time but it feels like I'm just not going to get everything done on time. 
2	I was moving my stuff back from school today and became very overwhelmed and stressed with how messy my room became with all of the excess stuff I am not used to having (from my dorm). I worried a lot about the COVID-19 virus and my grades. I got myself a few projects for my quarantine.

2	I feel lonely
2	I got lots of sleep last night but still somehow still feel tired. Not quite sure why that is. I also exercise and got some homework done so that's good too.

2	Today I had way too much work to do and not enough time to do it. I haven't had time to talk to people in my circle
2	Did some notes in the morning and then hung out with my girlfriend for the rest of the day. Went on a walk with her which was nice and then got some food. Later in the evening I came back home and played some video games. Looking forward to the next few days cause I have a break from school
2	i was up late last night completing assignments and I couldn't sleep well because my shoulder and neck really hurt. today my shoulder an dneck were still bothering me and it mad it hard to focus and concentrate on work and school. as well everyone at work was on edge workers and customers included and it was hard to remain positive when everyone around you is being negative. i completed my german homework but i didn't not get to study much before my quiz tomorrow. tomorrow my goals after my KINE class are to get my notes caught up for the last week. i am not going to watch any tv until all my notes are done and i have reviewed a bit of my work as well as listened o some of the book that we are doing in class tomorrow. 
2	Today I was very productive. I got caught up in my nutrition course and I got some more of my German quizes done. I?€?m a bit upset with myself how far behind I let myself get in my courses but it has made me set a goal for next semester. I am going to get all of my assignments done before the due date I don?€?t wanna be stressed and paniced with everything all the time and catching up for weeks of my work and notes. So I am going to satu on top of things. And when I do fall behind don?€?t get into the mind set of I?€?m already behind I?€?ll just latch up on the weekend because that?€?s a lot of work. I also have been lacking in excercising and I know I need to do better than I have. I have only been doing about a 5 to 10 minute workout just somthing to get me out of my desk chair and moving a little bit because I?€?m so behind in classes it?€?s hard to find time. So beginning over Christmas break I am going to begin working out regularly. This will also lead. Into next semester I will plan my days better and allow for time to exercise. With getting ahead on assignments I?€?ll have more time to myself to do things like exercise.

I havnt put laundry away in a few weeks just being so over whelmed with school and work I would wash it but then it has just been sitting in the basket clean in the middle of my bedroom. Today I finally put it away as well as rearranged my clothes to remove the summer clothes and pull out some items I no longer wear to give away.

It's too bad that I had an awful headache today cause I really wanted to get more done. The yoga practice helped but I didn't manage to make it to the conservatory for a violin practice.
